# ðŸ§¬ FASTQ to Differential Expression Pipeline (Kallisto + DESeq2)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/XGhoster1/fastq-to-DE/blob/main/notebooks/kallisto_pipeline.ipynb)

This repository contains a complete lightweight RNA-seq pipeline that takes raw FASTQ files to differential gene expression results using:

- **Kallisto** for transcript quantification (alignment-free, fast)
- **DESeq2** for differential expression in R
- **Google Colab** for cloud-based reproducibility
